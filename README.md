## About <a name = "about"></a>

This is the development repository for my HomeLab. It contains all the code and configurations for my HomeLab.

## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

You can't really get started with this repository, but you can use the code and configurations as a reference for your own HomeLab

## Folder Structure

- `pve01` - Contain the Ansible configurations of my kubernetes cluster by kubespray
- `docker-apps` - Contains all the standalone docker-compose files for the LXC containers
- `argocd-apps` - ArgoCD managed applications
- `k8s-apps` - YAML k8s manifests
- `k8s-infra-apps` - YAML k8s manifests for infrastructural components
- `terraform` - Terraform configurations with Proxmox Provider and Cloud-Init for supervising my VM clusters

## Hardware

- My "Powerful" Proxmox Node
  - Specs
    - 5700X
    - 64 GB RAM
    - 128 GB SSD (OS)
    - 1 TB SSD (Windows, yes I have a Windows OS dual booted)
    - 1 TB SSD (The old SSD for my storage)
    - 3 * 2 TB HDD (Not yet raided or ZFSed, but soon! Currently, they are happy with simple directory)
    - 128 GB USB (Ventoy for emergency booting)
    - GTX 660 (Just for my Windows OS, poor 5700X doesn't have integrated graphics)
    - A Pi4B attached to it for PiKVM! (I love it, the reason why my Proxmox is die hard.)
    - I bought the PCIe â†’ M.2 adapter, that's why I can have so many SSDs!
  - What's (will be) running on it?
    - (production) kubernetes cluster
    - heavy workloads

- My Always On Proxmox Node
  - Specs
    - N5105
    - 32 GB RAM
    - 4 * 2.5Gb LAN
  - What's already running on it?
    - Nginx Proxy Manager (Routing for my domain)
    - wg-easy (Most easy way to setup your WireGuard VPN)
    - AdGuard Home (I utilize the DNS rewrite for internal domain)

- My Raspberry Pi 4Bs (Thx to my friend [ac5tin](https://github.com/ac5tin) ðŸ˜˜)
  - Pi4B 8G * 2
  - Pi4B 4G * 2

- My Switch TP-Link TL-SG2016K
  - 16 Port 1 Gigabit Switch (You never need that much ports, do you? ðŸ˜‚)

## My Journey Notes

### General Tips

When working with `Helm` or `Kustomize`, always try template or dry-run before your git commit.

```bash
helm template .
kustomize build .

helm install test-release . --dry-run --debug
```

---

For first time installed apps, always deploy on an individual namespace so that you can `kubectl delete namesapce` to clean up everything.

---

### Cert Manager

- When using `helm`, do not install CRD with `installCRDs`,  use the `kubectl` approach instead, e.g. `kubectl apply -f https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.14.3/cert-manager.crds.yaml`, because the `installCRDs` provided by `helm` is not up-to-date.
- Deploy in namespace `kube-system`, do not deploy in `cert-manager`. Check [cert-manager fails to work correctly due to insufficient permissions on v2.18.0 Â· Issue #8393 Â· kubernetes-sigs/kubespray](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubespray/issues/8393)
